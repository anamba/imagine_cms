<p>Imagine CMS is a content management system originally developed for
internal use at Bigger Bird Creative (biggerbird.com). However, it was so
strongly bound to Rails that it became difficult to port to newer Rails
versions. Thus, sites using Imagine have been stuck on Rails 1.2 since time
immemorial.</p>

<p>This project intends to fix all that. By extracting Imagine functionality
out into a gem, we should be able to achieve compatibility with Rails 4.0
(hopefully around the time it is released). However, at the same time,
backwards compatibility with existing sites is extremely important, as the
whole reason for doing this is to allow us to upgrade existing sites to a
modern, supported version of Rails.</p>

<p>So… don’t use this. At least, not until the second phase of this
project (Imagine 4.x). Why? Well, the 3.x versions, while usable, will be
hobbled by their need to remain compatible with Bigger Bird’s existing
sites. The ERB templating language is dangerous (allows shell escapes) and
the editor is Firefox-only. Once we are into the 4.x era, when we can move
ahead without worrying about backward compatibility, it will be a good time
to get on board.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s coming up:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Imagine 3.0: 90% restored functionality, can function on existing sites
with no database changes</p>
</li><li>
<p>Imagine 3.1: 100% restored functionality, may require a few simple
migrations</p>
</li><li>
<p>Imagine 4.0: Refactoring &amp; rewriting of the worst parts
(substitutions); move away from ERB templating, to something like Liquid;
switch to a cross-browser editor</p>
</li></ul>

<p>(Imagine 1.x and 2.x have already been used internally, so we might as well
start at 3.0.)</p>
